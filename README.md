# What is this?
This repository is a clone of tbs/linux_media.
It contains patches for the following drivers

* stid135: ts6909x and tbs6903x cards (v1 and v2)
* stv091x: tbs5927 tbs6908 tbs6903 tbs6983 tbs6522 tbs6983 tbs6903 tbs6909
* tas2101: tbs5990, tbs6904
* si2183 based cards: tbs6504, tbs5580, tbs6916
* m88rs6060 based cards: tbs6902SE and tbs904SE. On these cards there is not IQ-scan (constellation display)
to support blindscan, to fix bugs and to make improvements.

# Installation

First install the required compilers, git ...
You may also need libproc-processtable-perl (e.g., on ubuntu)

```
mkdir ~/blindscan_kernel
cd  ~/blindscan_kernel
```

Check out the actual drivers. This uses the default branch which is called deepthought

```
git clone --depth=1  https://github.com/deeptho/linux_media.git ./media
```

Then  check out a copy of DeepThought's media_build (try tbs media_build if it does not work)

```
git clone https://github.com/deeptho/media_build
```

Make sure software for kernel compilation is installed.
For instance on fedora:

```
sudo dnf install -y patchutils
sudo dnf install -y ccache
sudo dnf install -y kernel-devel-`uname -r`
sudo dnf install -y perl-File-Copy #not needed?
sudo dnf install -y perl
sudo dnf install -y perl-Proc-ProcessTable

cd media_build
git checkout deepthought
git reset --hard
make dir DIR=../media
make distclean
./install.sh
```

Last but not least, install rsyslog so that kernel debug messages are stored in the file system
in /var/log/debug:

```
sudo dnf install -y rsyslog
sudo vi /etc/rsyslog.conf # add "kern.debug /var/log/debug" line
sudo systemctl enable rsyslog
sudo systemctl start rsyslog #to have log messages in /var/log/debug
```

Now install the firmware (if needed):

```
wget http://www.tbsdtv.com/download/document/linux/tbs-tuner-firmwares_v1.0.tar.bz2
sudo tar jxvf tbs-tuner-firmwares_v1.0.tar.bz2 -C /lib/firmware/
```

If you cannot find the 6909 firmware:

```
wget http://www.tbsdtv.com/download/document/linux/dvb-fe-mxl5xx.fw
sudo cp dvb-fe-mxl5xx.fw /lib/firmware/
```

Now load the drivers: either reboot, or try loading the proper module for your card, e.g., tbsecp3
for many cards:

```
sudo modprobe tbsecp3
```

Check /var/log/debug for messages. If there are i2c_xfer error messages, try editing
the file tbsecp3-cards.c. In that file lcate the entry for your card and change i2c_speed
to 9.

If you have this problem then report it. Also report if the solution works,

# Changes in release-1.2
* Added sysfs entries in /sys/modules/stid135/
* Allow setting the default rf input for each demod, for use with tvheadend. This allows more than one slave
  tuner to use the same rf input connector on the card.
* Incorporated changes from the official tbs drivers up to July 11 2024.
* Improved determination of card mac addresses and generating fake mac addresses should the card not have one set.
* Support for the tbs6916 card.
* Bug: stid135 based cards sends out 21kHz tone and diseqc base frequency instead of 22kHz and this causes some
  diseqc switcches to sometimes ignore commands.
* Provide additional ioctls to support "syncrhonized" calls, where one adapter can wait on another adapter
  to finish setting voltages, tones and sending diseqc commands
* Protection against drivers which blindly assume name to be of size 128.
* Bug: fe_read_status should not return -1 on timeout.
* stv091x: fix isi scan.
* Bug: tuning loop runs to early when diseqc is sent but no tuning info is present yet.

# Changes in release-0.9.0

* Blindscan and spectrum upport for montage m88rs60606 based cards: tbs6902SE and tbs2904SE.
* Support m883s6060 module unloading
* stid135: BER is now reported properly othrough the PRE instead of POST error counters

* stid135: detected multi-stream IDs are now accumalated internally
* Added DTV_BIT_RATE readout via dvbapi
* stid135: improper estimation of required  llr rate, causing rai multistream on 5.0W to not tune sometimes
  (green blocks in picture)
* stid135: changed default spectral resolution: slightly slower scan, but more narrow-band muxes found
* Add support for timing lock flag
* stv091x: return more correct data about currently tuned mux (instead of returning what user requested)


# Known problems
* si2183 based cards: blindscan cannot discover stream_ids in multistreams, unless it is given
 one of them when starting the blindscan. In that case, it will find the other ones
