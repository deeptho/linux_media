# What is this?
This repository is a clone of tbs/linux_media.
It contains patches for the following drivers
* stid135: ts6909x and tbs6903x cards
* stv091x: tbs5927
* tas2101 (incomplete): tbs5990, tbs6904
* si2183 based cards: tbs6504

to support blindscan, to fix bugs and to make improvements.


# Known problems
* si2183 based cards: blindscan cannot discover stream_ids in multistreams, unless it is given
 one of them when starting the blindscan. In that case, it will find the other ones


User space tools for using blindscan can be found at
